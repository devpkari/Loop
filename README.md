In the landscape of web development, the translation of visual representations of HTML structures, such as wireframes or mockups, into actual HTML code is a crucial yet time-consuming task. This project aims to revolutionize this process by developing an advanced AI/ML model capable of automatically converting HTML diagrams represented in image format into corresponding HTML code.

The Challenge:
Traditionally, developers and designers have relied on manual transcription to convert visual HTML diagrams into code, a process prone to errors and time-intensive iterations. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between the visual representation of HTML structures and their accurate translation into functional HTML code.

The Solution:
The proposed solution entails harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to automate the conversion process. By leveraging cutting-edge techniques in computer vision, natural language processing, and sequence-to-sequence modeling, the model will be trained to analyze HTML diagram images and generate corresponding HTML code accurately and efficiently.
